The data file uploaded is .gzip due to the file size limit imposed by git, one can convert it to .csv using pandas library
and can start working on it and make sure you have economic-data for correlation of crime data with economic factors.
1. Overall Crime Trends:
   Calculate and plot the total number of crimes per year to visualize the trends.
2. Seasonal Patterns:
   Group the data by month and analyze the average number of crimes per month over
the years.
3. Most Common Crime Type:
   Count the occurrences of each crime type and identify the one with the highest
frequency.
4. Regional Differences:
   Group the data by region or city and compare crime rates between them using descriptive statistics or visualizations.
5. Correlation with Economic Factors:
    Collect economic data for the same time frame and use statistical methods like correlation analysis to assess the 
    relationship between economic factors and crime rates.

   Mean per capital income, population below poverty line, unemployment, and employment for the years 2020, 2021, 2023. 
   Scatter plots & Correlation coefficient was used to show the strength of association between economic factors & number of 
   crimes per year. The data was derived from the [US Census Bureau website.] 
   (https://data.census.gov/profile/Los_Angeles_city,_California?g=160XX00US0644000)
7. Day of the Week Analysis:
   Group the data by day of the week and analyze crime frequencies for each day.
8. Impact of Major Events:
    Identify major events or policy changes during the dataset period and analyze crime rate changes before and after these 
    events.
9. Outliers and Anomalies:
   Use statistical methods or data visualization techniques to identify dataset outliers and investigate unusual patterns.
10. Demographic Factors:
   Analyze the dataset to identify any patterns or correlations between demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) and specific 
   types of crimes.
11. Predicting Future Trends:
    Employ time series forecasting methods, such as ARIMA or Prophet, to predict future crime trends based on historical 
     data. Consider incorporating relevant external factors into your models
